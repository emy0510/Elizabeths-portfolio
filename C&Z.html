            <h3>Who you did the work for/with:</h3>
                <p>I worked with the couple, Zack and Catherine</p>
            <h3>Approximately a paragraph explanation of the goals of the shoot:</h3>
                <p>The goal of this shoot from the client was to get cute, Instagramable pictures.<br>
                I did that by asking them to cordinate their outfits and took them to a cute lake. <br>
                For about half the time I gave them poses to do then the other half I gave them prompts like "chase her", "twirll her" "sneak up behind him and hug him from behind"<br>
                so that I could get real, candid moments. </p>
            <h3>Your role in the project</h3>
                <p>I was the creative directer, photographer and editor. </p>
            <h3>Collaborators:</h3>
                <p>I did not collaborate with anyone on this shoot </p>
            <h3>Start and end times:</h3>
                <p>Start: 10/08/22<br>
                    End: 10/15/22</p>
            <h3>Challenges encountered:</h3>
                <p> One of the most challenging parts of this experience was making them comfortable in  front of the camera. <br> 
                    They were both pretty stiff when we started so the earlier shots look very uncomfortable.</p>
            <h3>Things that you tried but did not work:</h3>
                <p> I tried them in different poses that I have seen online and some of them worked for what they were going for and some of them didn't.<br> 
                    They were very vocal about the poses that they felt uncomfortable in. </p>
            <h3>What you might do differently:</h3>
                <p>If and when I work with them again, I would give them more candid opportunities earlier in the session. Some of their favorite pictures were ones that were candids of them interacting with eachother</p>
            <h3>What you accomplished:</h3>
                <p>I successfully made a couple who does not take pictures often relax and become comfortable and confident in front of a camera.</p>
            <h3>Main thing you learned from the project:</h3>
                <p>I learned that part of being a photographer who photographs people is all about working on the fly. Being adaptable is very important.</p>
