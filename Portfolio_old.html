                    <p>This shoot was all about playing with fun textures and colors. She had just dyed her hair and wanted the setting to match. I would not do anything different with this shoot.<p>

                    <p>This client wanted something simple but cute that she could post on social media. She wanted to be outdoors and lots of green so I found her a park. I would not do anything different with this shoot.</p>

                    <p>Kaylee Withrow- 6/23/23</p>
                    <p>This shoot is part of a series I'm doing all about colors- her favorite color is purple so she loved doing this shoot. I would not do anything different with this shoot.</p>

                        <p>She wanted something bold for this picture which is why I put her in this pose. This was the hardest lighting I've had to work with ever. If I could redo this shoot, I would take more time working with the lighting.</p>

                    <p>These clients wanted that classic silhouette look so I took them out to a lake near by at sunset. I would not do anything different with this shoot.</p>

                    <p>Kaylee really let my creativity run wild with this photoshoot and we played with different lightings- now that was a challenge!</p>

                    <p>Something I learned from this photoshoot is to play with lighting more! It can create some unique pictures. I would not do anything different with this shoot.</p>

                    <p>We also played with fabric during this shoot so it was interesting to move it in different ways to make different effects. I would not do anything different with this shoot.</p>

                    <p>In any photoshoot, it is always a collaboration between client and photographer. <br>No two shoots are the ever the exact same. <br>
                       There are many factors that go into a photoshoot like lighting, locations or weather that can cause a challenge that we have to face.<br>
                        Photographers have to be good at thinking on their feet and I always feel very accomplished after a photoshoot. </p>
