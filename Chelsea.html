            <h3>Who you did the work for/with:</h3>
                <p>I worked with Chelsea Ghormley, a person I use to work with.</p>
            <h3>Approximately a paragraph explanation of the goals of the project:</h3>
                <p>This shoot was all about playing with fun textures and colors. She had just dyed her hair and wanted the setting to match.<br>
                We found the SweetTooth Hotel in Dallas that had great reviews for being a fun colorful art installation with lots of photo ops and<br>
                we knew it was the perfect place for us. </p>
            <h3>Your role in the project</h3>
                <p>I was the creative directer, photographer, and editor.</p>
            <h3>Collaborators:</h3>
                <p>I did not collaborate with another photographer but I always try to collaborate with the modles to an extent.</p>
            <h3>Start and end times:</h3>
                <p>8/10/23- 8/15/23</p>
            <h3>Personal insights gained:</h3>
                <p>I have never done a shoot that was focused on colors and had so many involved. <br>
                    Each room created a different challenge, lighting, colors, textures, vibes were all different room to room <br>
                    which created some really unique pictures.</p>
            <h3>Challenges encountered:</h3>
                <p>Since each room had drastically different lighting, camera settings and editing were a little challenging.</p>
            <h3>Things that you tried but did not work:</h3>
                <p>There were poses that one of us thought would look good that turned out to look a little bit awkward. </p>
            <h3>What you might do differently:</h3>
                <p>I am really satisfied with how these pictures turned out and I would not change anything.</p>
            <h3>What you accomplished:</h3>
                <p>I successfully worked with techniques that were out of my comfort zone in a place that I wasn't familliar with that had a wide variety of lighting. </p>
            <h3>Main thing you learned from the project:</h3>
                <p>I learned that playing with lighting and editing techniques can be really fun!</p>
